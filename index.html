        <p class="lead mb-4">My dance journey started all the way in elementary school. At the time, I made two new friends named Belah and Maria. We found out our school was doing a talent show and decided that we wanted to perform in it. From what I remember, it was a choreographic dance to a mix of One Direction songs. At the time, we were fourth graders so I was not too serious about dancing, but I did perform because I realized I enjoy the attention. After that first performance, our friends and teachers at the time complimented us and said how they really enjoyed the show! Our family also had footage now to show off on Facebook about how talented their kids were. A couple years later in middle school, Belah, Maria, and I decided we needed to recreate that moment. This time, older and more mature, we decided to dance to the song, ‚ÄúSlow Motion by Trey Songz‚Äù choreographed by Matt Stefanina. This time we had more structured rehearsals and more control of our bodies. We even planned formations and costumes. By the time we got on stage, I was center of the formation and ready to go. Our grinding movements had the middle school crowd go crazy! After then, I joined a dance team called Syndikidz and was even given the superlative ‚ÄúBest Dancer‚Äù in middle school. Slowly, my identity as a dancer started to become more significant for me. In high school, it was a new field of organizations and activities. On a day called, ‚ÄúClog Rush‚Äù which was a day where clubs were recruiting new members, my friend Sachi Khurna signed me up for our high school‚Äôs hip hop club. There was when I progressed in positions from Treasurer, to Vice President, to Co-President. Here was also when I began choreographing and leading groups of people. That is what jump started my dancing career.
<br><br>

        Now, I am a 2nd year student majoring in dance at the University of California, Riverside. As a grown adult with full agency, I feel I have the potential to really launch my dance career. I am currently in a dance team called ‚Äú909 Dance Troupe‚Äù and am finally leaving after two years of residency. Here I was able to train competitively for the first time in my life. In my journey within 909, I was able to find my love for community and be inspired by the people around me. Now, I am ready to explore the dance world outside of Riverside. Furthermore, my peers and educators in the dance department help launch me into the more financial aspects of dance. Just this past week, I had my first paid gig performing my own choreography at Norco College. Shoutout Professor Pasion!<br><br>
